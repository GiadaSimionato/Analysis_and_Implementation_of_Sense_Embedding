# Analysis and Implementation of Sense Embedding
Project repository of the second homework for the course of Natural Language Processing, Sapienza University of Rome.

This repository contains the Python implementation of the framework for data preprocessing and deep assignment of Sense Embeddings.
The implementation was based on the EuroSense dataset.

This work was completed on June 6th, 2019.
